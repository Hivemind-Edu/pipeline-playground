    meticulously examining evidence (data) to solve a specific case (hypothesis).
    Data Science is the whole precinct â€“ using that detective work, plus hacking
    skills and business smarts, to predict and prevent future crime waves.'

  aiImagePrompt: A split-screen image. On the left, a classic, Sherlock Holmes-style
    detective with a magnifying glass, looking closely at a single footprint. The
    background is a dusty, atmospheric library. On the right, a bustling, modern
    police command center with multiple glowing screens showing data visualizations,
    predictive maps, and code. The overall style is cinematic and high-contrast.

  text: The Central Limit Theorem is the secret sauce. It says that if you take enough
    random samples from ANY population (no matter how weirdly shaped), the averages
    of those samples will form a nice, predictable bell curve. This is why we can
    make inferences about everyone without talking to everyone. It's the foundation
    of modern statistics.

  aiImagePrompt: A chaotic, jagged, and unpredictable landscape representing a 'weird
    population'. From this landscape, several helicopters are airlifting small, square
    plots of land. These plots are being arranged on a separate, clean grid. As more
    plots are added, the stacks of plots begin to form a perfect, glowing bell curve
    shape. The style is futuristic and illustrative.
