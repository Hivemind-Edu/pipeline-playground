text: "People confuse Marketing and Sales all the time. Think of it like a play. Marketing writes the script, builds the set, and sells the tickets, creating an audience that *wants* to be there. Sales is the lead actor who steps onto that stage and delivers a performance that closes the show."

aiImagePrompt: "A split-screen image. On the left, a bustling backstage of a theater with people writing scripts, designing costumes, and building sets, labeled 'Marketing'. On the right, a single charismatic actor on a beautifully lit stage, captivating an eager audience, labeled 'Sales'."

text: "You can't whisper to a crowd. You have to speak to a single person. That's why we create a 'Customer Avatar' or 'Buyer Persona'—a detailed profile of your one ideal customer. It's not about demographics; it's about their dreams and their demons."
displayStyle: "AI_IMAGE"
aiImagePrompt: "A detailed, realistic portrait of a fictional person, surrounded by smaller icons and notes representing their hobbies, goals, fears, and daily frustrations. The style is like a detective's corkboard, connecting disparate clues into a coherent whole."

text: "So, let's tie it all together. You start with empathy to build an avatar. You use the funnel as your map. You tell a story structured by AIDA to move them along that map. And you use social proof to build trust at every stage. It's not a machine. It's a conversation, guided by a deep understanding of the person on the other side."
