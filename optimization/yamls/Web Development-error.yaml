  text: 'At the heart of every world you build are three core forces: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Think of it like building a house. HTML is the raw structure: the foundation, the walls, the roof. CSS is the interior design: the paint, the furniture, the art. JavaScript is the electricity and plumbing: it makes the lights turn on and the water run. You need all three to make a home.'

  text: A useful clarification on the "house" analogy: while we teach them as separate subjects, in the real world, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are deeply intertwined. A leaky pipe (bad JS) can ruin the drywall (your HTML/CSS). A solid foundation makes everything else easier. Never think of them in total isolation.

  text: 'Let''s lay the foundation. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) isn''t a programming language; it''s a *markup* language. You use it to describe the content. You "mark up" your text with tags to tell the browser, "This is a headline," "This is a paragraph," "This is an image." Simple, right? But from these simple tags, entire universes are built.'

  text: 'Behold, the DOM Tree! This is how the browser *sees* your HTML. Not as a flat text file, but as a nested structure of objects, like a family tree. Every tag is a branch. Understanding this structure is the key to manipulating your world with CSS and JavaScript.'

  aiImagePrompt: A beautiful, luminous tree where the trunk is the <html> tag, major branches are <head> and <body>, and smaller branches and leaves are<h1>, <p>, and <div> tags. The style should be clean, clear, and educational.

  text: 'Time to paint the walls. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is where the magic of design happens. You write "rules" to select HTML elements and tell them how to look. "All headlines should be blue." "All images should have a soft shadow." This separation is powerful: you can completely redesign your entire "house" just by swapping out the stylesheet.'

  text: A common tripwire for beginners: JavaScript running in the browser is primarily used for "front-end" development (what the user sees and interacts with). But thanks to environments like Node.js, you can also use JavaScript to write the "back-end" code that runs on the server. One language, two sides of the coin. Don't worry about the back-end for now, just know it exists.
