    the story?" Every history book, every documentary, every feed... it's a map.

    correctIndex: 1
  - question: Why is it important to question who writes a historical account?
    answers:
    - Because older historical accounts are usually less accurate.
    - Because historians from different countries are natural rivals.
    - Because every author has a perspective, biases, and a specific audience in
      mind.
    correctIndex: 2
  - question: The concept of history as a "map" rather than the "territory" suggests
      that...
    answers:
    - Historical accounts are simplified representations of a much more complex past.
    - We should only trust histories that include geographical maps.
    - Most historical events are about disputes over land.
