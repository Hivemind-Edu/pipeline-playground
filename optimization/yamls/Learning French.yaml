text: "In French, every noun is either masculine or feminine. 'A book' is 'un livre' (masculine), and 'a table' is 'une table' (feminine). This isn't about logic; it's about grammar. It's a feature inherited from Latin. Don't ask 'why' a table is female. Just accept it. For now."

aiImagePrompt: "A surrealist painting where a book has a mustache and a bow tie (le livre) and a dining table is wearing a dress and pearls (la table). The style is whimsical and slightly absurd, reminiscent of René Magritte."
