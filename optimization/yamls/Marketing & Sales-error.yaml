The world around them is a blur of motion, but they are a still point of perfect connection and understanding. The style should be warm, painterly, and slightly impressionistic."

The classic '4 Ps' isn't a rigid formula, it's a way to organize your empathy.\n\n*   **Product:** The *thing* you've made to solve the problem.\n*   **Price:** The value exchange. What's it worth to them to have this problem solved?\n*   **Place:** Where do you meet them? Where are they already looking for solutions?\n*   **Promotion:** The conversation. How do you let them know you have the answer?"

Each of the four cardinal directions is a glowing icon: a heart for Product (the solution), scales for Price (the value), a map pin for Place (the meeting point), and two speech bubbles for Promotion (the conversation). The style is elegant and slightly magical, like a fantasy map."

Are you trying to genuinely solve a problem for someone, or are you just trying to hit a quota? The first creates loyalty. The second creates buyer's remorse. We're here to learn the first."
