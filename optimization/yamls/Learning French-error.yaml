  text: "First things first: in French, everything has a gender. A table? Feminine. A book? Masculine. Don't fight it, just accept it as a charming quirk. Think of it like this: every object in the French-speaking world has a secret identity. Your mission is to learn their secrets. We'll start with 'un' for masculine things and 'une' for feminine things."

  aiImagePrompt: "A whimsical, slightly surreal illustration of a book wearing a tiny fedora (masculine) and a table wearing a string of pearls (feminine). The style should be charming and a little bit quirky, like a children's book illustration for adults."

  text: "A quick tip on 'Bonjour': it's not just a greeting, it's a key. In France, you say 'Bonjour' to the bus driver, the shopkeeper, the person you make eye contact with in an elevator. It's a sign of respect, and it will open doors for you, literally and figuratively."

  text: "Ready for a little magic? It's called 'liaison'. Sometimes, a silent consonant at the end of a word comes to life when the next word starts with a vowel. For example, 'vous êtes' (you are) isn't 'voo et', it's 'voo-Zet'. This is the secret sauce to sounding less like a tourist and more like a local."
