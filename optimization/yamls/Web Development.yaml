text: "Stop thinking of websites as 'pages'. Think of them as places. Worlds you build from nothing. Before you write a single line of code, you need to understand the magic trick. You type a name, press Enter, and a world appears. That's not magic, it's a conversation between two computers. Let's learn the language."

text: "The conversation has two sides: the 'Client' (your browser) and the 'Server' (a powerful computer holding the website's files). The Client asks, 'Hey, can I see this website?' and the Server responds, 'Sure, here are all the files you need to build it.' This is the Client-Server model, the heartbeat of the entire web."

aiImagePrompt: "A sleek, stylized diagram showing a laptop (the client) sending a glowing request packet across a network to a large, powerful server. The server is shown sending back a response packet containing code symbols (HTML, CSS, JS). The style is modern and minimalist."

text: "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the blueprint and the wooden frame of the house. It's not pretty. It's just the raw structure: this is a wall, this is a door, this is the roof. It gives everything its place and meaning. Without HTML, you just have a pile of lumber."

aiImagePrompt: "A ghostly, wireframe architectural blueprint of a house, showing only the essential structure like beams, walls, and floors. On top of the blueprint, simple labels point to elements like '<header>', '<body>', and '<footer>'. The image is stark and unadorned."

text: "Next up is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). This is your interior designer. CSS takes the raw HTML structure and makes it beautiful. It's the paint on the walls, the style of the furniture, the font on the welcome mat. It's all about presentation and aesthetics."

aiImagePrompt: "The same wireframe house from before, but now it's being filled with vibrant color, textures, and stylish furniture. A floating paintbrush is painting one wall a rich blue, representing the application of CSS to the HTML structure."

text: "Cute analogy, but remember this: 'cascading' is the key word. Styles can be inherited from parent elements, but also overridden. This power is amazing, but it can lead to infuriating bugs where you can't figure out WHY that button is blue. This 'cascade' is something you'll wrestle with your entire career. Respect it."

text: "Finally, JavaScript (JS). This is the electricity, the plumbing, the WiFi. It makes the house *functional*. The lights turn on (a button click), the garage door opens (an animation), the TV plays a movie (dynamic content). It turns a static model into a living home."
displayStyle: "AI_IMAGE"
aiImagePrompt: "The fully designed house, now with glowing lines of electricity running through the walls. Interactive elements are highlighted: a garage door is mid-opening, a light switch is glowing, and a screen inside is displaying changing content, symbolizing JavaScript's dynamic capabilities."

text: "This is all built on a concept called the Document Object Model (DOM). Think of it as the browser taking the HTML blueprint and building a logical, interactive tree structure from it. JavaScript doesn't directly change the HTML file; it manipulates this DOM tree to alter what you see on the page."
