  text: "Welcome to your learning feed for React! Let's start with the basics. React is a free, open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Meta (formerly Facebook). React allows developers to create reusable UI components, which makes building and maintaining user interfaces more efficient."

  text: "React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Think of them like LEGO bricks; you can build something small with one, or combine them to create something big and complex. Buttons, forms, and navigation bars are all examples of elements that can be built as components in a React application."

  text: "One of the key features of React is JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code directly within your JavaScript. This might look a bit strange at first, but it makes writing and visualizing your UI components much more intuitive."

  text: "In React, we have 'props' and 'state'. Props (short for properties) are like arguments you pass to a function, allowing a parent component to pass data to a child component. State, on the other hand, is like a component's memory, allowing it to keep track of information and change it in response to user interactions."

  text: "That's a great way to think about it! A parent component will often hold information in its state and then pass that information down to child components as props."

  text: "Each React component has a lifecycle with three main phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. Mounting is when the component is being created and inserted into the DOM. Updating occurs when a component's state or props change. Finally, Unmounting is when a component is being removed from the DOM."
