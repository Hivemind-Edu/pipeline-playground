While it's robust, remember that newer libraries like Zustand often provide a simpler path for centralization now, especially when compared to the initial boilerplate of classic Redux setups. RTK streamlines this significantly, though. The key takeaway is that for complex global state, centralized management beats cascading props/Context updates for performance."

When we use RTL, we are essentially ensuring that if a user can see a button labeled 'Save' and clicking it performs the intended action, the test passes. This results in far more valuable and resilient test suites."
