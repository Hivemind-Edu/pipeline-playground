          "text": "Great questions! Let's tackle the difference between props and state first. Think of them both as plain JavaScript objects that hold information, but their purpose and source are distinct. Props (short for properties) are like arguments passed to a function. They are external, passed down from a parent component to a child component, and are immutable—meaning the child component cannot change the props it receives. State, on the other hand, is the component's internal memory. It manages data that is local to the component and is expected to change over time, typically in response to user actions (like clicking a button or typing in an input field). When state changes, React re-renders the component."

When React sees a tag starting with a lowercase letter (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<img>`), it treats it as a standard HTML element. However, when it encounters a tag starting with a capital letter (e.g., `<Welcome>`, `<Sidebar>`, `<MyButton>`), it recognizes it as a custom React Component that needs to be rendered and managed by your application. If you don't capitalize your custom components, React will try to render them as undefined HTML tags."

Often, you need to group several elements together (like a list of items or adjacent headers and paragraphs) without wrapping them in an extra HTML element like a `<div>`. If you were to wrap them in a redundant `<div>`, it adds unnecessary depth and complexity to the DOM tree, which can sometimes impact performance or layout flexibility. A Fragment allows you to group multiple elements to satisfy the 'single return element' requirement without introducing any extra nodes into the actual rendered HTML."
